# WP Tournament Registration

*A WordPress plugin for registering players with tournaments*

The plugin was originally developed for the WordPress blog of [my local chess club ESV Rot-Weiß Göttingen](https://schach-goettingen.de/) in order to ease the registration process for the open club championship.

## Installation and Usage

Head over to WordPress' plugin repository [WP Tournament Registration](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-tournament-registration/) or study the `readme.txt` file.
