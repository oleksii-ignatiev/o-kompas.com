Create members, competitions (leagues, ladder, knockout) (and, optional, invoices) for your (sports) club. Easy to manage and to publish on your site. For all sports.

== Description ==

This plugin saves you a lot of work and time in managing your club. You can manage data for all your members, manage your club's competitions and matches, and manage invoices.   

You can start small by creating members. By enabling the competitions feature, you can create as many competitions for your members as you wish. There are built-in competition formats for leagues, knockout tournaments, and individual scoring (applicable for golf, shooting, trainings statistics, etc.); all for individual competitors and teams. Plan your matches and add scores. Rankings are automatically generated. It's optional to create invoices (e.g. for the annual fee that members pay). 

A full set of shortcodes and widgets enables publication on your WordPress site.

This plugin in written with extendability in mind to support any sport and competition format. 

Unlike other sports plugins, you not only manage and publish matches and leagues, but everything is centered around the most important people in your club: your members. A member can readily get an overview of his/her personal data (address, e-mail, etc.), of his/her invoices, and of all completed and open competitions.
