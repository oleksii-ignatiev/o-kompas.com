Requires at least: 5.4
Tested up to: 5.8.1
Stable tag: 0.5

Control individual menu items' visibility based on your desired condition.

== Description ==

Using this plugin you can use WordPress <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Conditional_Tags">Conditional Tags</a> to enable or disable menu items on the front-end. It works like 'Widget Logic' but for menu items.

*PLEASE NOTE* The conditions are PHP codes that are evaluated using PHP's "<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.eval.php">eval</a>" function, meaning anyone who has access to the Menu manager in WordPress can execute any code. Be mindful of who has access to the Menu manager.

= Usage =
You must insert conditional tags in the "Visibility" box in the menu item options form. You can use any PHP or WordPress functions to build crazy conditions and logics for menu items. For example, to hide the menu item on homepage you can set the visibility to:
<pre><code>! is_home()</code></pre>

Show the menu only to logged-in users: 
<pre><code>is_user_logged_in()</code></pre>

Show the menu only to guest visitors: 
<pre><code>! is_user_logged_in()</code></pre>

To show the menu item based on <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/">user capability</a>:
<pre><code>current_user_can( 'manage_options' )</code></pre>


== Installation ==

1. Upload the `menu-item-visibility` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Locate the 'Menus' item on the 'Appearance' menu
4. While editing your menu item, you see another option: Visibility, input your logic and that's it.
